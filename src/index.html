        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Russell Lubojacky, a seasoned technology consultant specializing in backend application architecture and delivery, with a notable career span of 25 years. My journey has encompassed working alongside diverse clients across a multitude of industries, successfully navigating the complexities and specificities each sector presents.</p>

        <p>Recently, I have pivoted my career path, transitioning from my role within a consulting firm to embrace the dynamic world of freelancing as a software engineer and architect. This decision was fueled by a desire to delve deeper into hands-on technical work and strategic architectural planning.</p>
          
        <p>It is pertinent to note that my professional interests are firmly rooted in technical and architectural aspects. Consequently, I do not engage in creating PowerPoint presentations or assume sales-oriented roles.</p>
          
        <p>Thank you for considering this delineation of my professional journey and current standing. I am eagerly looking forward to building and architecting solutions that drive technological advancement.</p>
